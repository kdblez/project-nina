Rules
=======
Characters are selected for battle and placed onto the battle screen, which is a grid. Characters have an original attack with either arms. Magic characters will gain MP once it's their turn. The team is made up of 6 characters. Each team will have a phase where they can strike at the characters or move on the board. A turn is done after 2 phases are done. This could change to probably 12 characters. 

- Characters can counterattack if possible from the sides or front.
- the back adds extra points and reduces Speed
- Characters will receive EXP based on moves. 
- If all characters are defeated, on one side, the game is over.
- If someone submits or there is a connection lost(unwillingly), game's over.
- before the character officially dies, they go unconcious for two turns and then awake, causing the guage to be used for health instead. The critical health gauge is about 30% of whatever the main bar is. 
- if all characters are unconcious, the instead battle over
- if a character dies, it's gone forever
- if a character gets to the health bar, and the battle is over, the chaaracter will be injured until he is mended.
- if a team wins, and there are unconcious characters, the victor can choose to hold a unit captive. 
- if a character is killed on the other team, the opposition earns 50 Gold/ 20 EXP
- if a character kills three men, he's given a bonus of 300 Gold for the team
